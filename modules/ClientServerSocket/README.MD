# Client Server Socket

The `Client-Server Socket` module is designed for teaching networking concepts through practical application. It
provides an engaging way for students to learn about socket programming by implementing a client in C that interacts
with a server via socket connections. This module encompasses establishing a connection, performing a handshake, and
responding to server-sent questions, thereby offering a comprehensive hands-on experience in network programming.

## Project Requirement

To successfully complete this module, students are required to develop a client capable of establishing a connection
with a remote server and accurately solving questions received from the server. This involves understanding socket
programming concepts, client-server architecture, and applying logical reasoning to solve the presented problems.

## Key Learning Outcomes:

- Establishing a socket connection with a server.
- Understanding and implementing the handshake protocol.
- Solving algorithmic questions sent by the server.

## Supported Features

This module supports[^1] generating following files:

- [x] **Autograder**
- [x] **Documentation**
- [x] **Solution**
- [ ] **Starter Code**

[^1]A sample solution is generated, utilizing the `QA.py` to solve the problem. Instructors are encouraged to implement
and test the native solving algorithm in C by modifying the `void solve_question(char* question, char* answer)` function
in the generated `client.c` file.

## Additional Feature: Server Deployment for Testing

- **Misc - Server**: Contains a server implementation that instructors can deploy to provide students with a real-time
  testing environment. Students can interact with this server to test their client code. To run the server, execute
  the `run.sh` script within the server folder.

## Configuration

- **Question Format**: Specifies the format of questions that will be sent to the client, such as "operand operator
  operand", indicating questions like "number + number" or "number - number".

- **Testcase Visibility**: Controls whether test cases are visible to students before the due date.

- **Magic String**: A predefined string that each message between the client and server starts with, facilitating a
  unique protocol for message handling.

- **Points for Connect**: The number of points awarded for successfully establishing a connection with the server.

- **Points for Disconnect**: Points awarded for correctly disconnecting from the server after completing the tasks.

- **Points for Each Question**: The amount of points allocated for each correctly solved question.

- **Question Count**: Total number of questions the server will send to the client.

- **Port**: The port number used for the server-client communication. If set to -1, a default or random port will be
  used.

- **Basic Test**: A boolean flag that, when true, enables a preliminary test consisting of one question to verify the
  server-client sanity.

- **Basic Test Points**: Points awarded for passing the basic test.

### QA.py

To facilitate the generation of questions and evaluation of answers, instructors must provide algorithms within QA.py
file:

- ```generateQuestion() ```
  This function is responsible for randomly generating questions based on the question_format. These questions are sent
  to the client for solving.

- ```solveQuestion()```
  Acts as the solver for the questions generated by generateQuestion(). It parses the question string, computes the
  answer, and returns the expected result. The client's response must match this answer for the test to pass.
